[TOC]

This component can be used for grasp selection. The component should be initialized with the 
available grasp databases and workcell descriptions of the gripper that is to be used and
the objects. 

The selection of a feasible grasp will be determined from quality measures and from 
collision information in the relevant online scenario of grasping.
