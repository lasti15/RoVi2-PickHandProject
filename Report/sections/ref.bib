	Abstract = {Importance 
Some patients with lower leg amputations may be candidates for motorized prosthetic limbs. Optimal control of such devices requires accurate classification of the patient's ambulation mode (eg, on level ground or ascending stairs) and natural transitions between different ambulation modes.Objective
To determine the effect of including electromyographic (EMG) data and historical information from prior gait strides in a real-time control system for a powered prosthetic leg capable of level-ground walking, stair ascent and descent, ramp ascent and descent, and natural transitions between these ambulation modes.Design, Setting, and Participants
Blinded, randomized crossover clinical trial conducted between August 2012 and November 2013 in a research laboratory at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago. Participants were 7 patients with unilateral above-knee (n = 6) or knee-disarticulation (n = 1) amputations. All patients were capable of ambulation within their home and community using a passive prosthesis (ie, one that does not provide external power).Interventions
Electrodes were placed over 9 residual limb muscles and EMG signals were recorded as patients ambulated and completed 20 circuit trials involving level-ground walking, ramp ascent and descent, and stair ascent and descent. Data were acquired simultaneously from 13 mechanical sensors embedded on the prosthesis. Two real-time pattern recognition algorithms, using either (1) mechanical sensor data alone or (2) mechanical sensor data in combination with EMG data and historical information from earlier in the gait cycle, were evaluated. The order in which patients used each configuration was randomized (1:1 blocked randomization) and double-blinded so patients and experimenters did not know which control configuration was being used.Main Outcomes and Measures
The main outcome of the study was classification error for each real-time control system. Classification error is defined as the percentage of steps incorrectly predicted by the control system.Results
Including EMG signals and historical information in the real-time control system resulted in significantly lower classification error (mean, 7.9\% [95\% CI, 6.1\%-9.7\%]) across a mean of 683 steps (range, 640-756 steps) compared with using mechanical sensor data only (mean, 14.1\% [95\% CI, 9.3\%-18.9\%]) across a mean of 692 steps (range, 631-775 steps), with a mean difference between groups of 6.2\% (95\% CI, 2.7\%-9.7\%] (P = .01).Conclusions and Relevance
In this study of 7 patients with lower limb amputations, inclusion of EMG signals and temporal gait information reduced classification error across ambulation modes and during transitions between ambulation modes. These preliminary findings, if confirmed, have the potential to improve the control of powered leg prostheses.},

@article{vacchetti_stable_2004,
	Abstract = {We propose an efficient real-time solution for tracking rigid objects in 3D using a single camera that can handle large camera displacements, drastic aspect changes, and partial occlusions. While commercial products are already available for offline camera registration, robust online tracking remains an open issue because many real-time algorithms described in the literature still lack robustness and are prone to drift and jitter. To address these problems, we have formulated the tracking problem in terms of local bundle adjustment and have developed a method for establishing image correspondences that can equally well handle short and wide-baseline matching. We then can merge the information from preceding frames with that provided by a very limited number of keyframes created during a training stage, which results in a real-time tracker that does not jitter or drift and can deal with significant aspect changes.},

The combined system is able to track a natural hand at 30 frames per second on a standard workstation with no special image processing hardware other than a frame grabber. The tracker has been used as an interface for navigating around virtual worlds},

@inproceedings{stenger_model-based_2001,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a practical technique for model-based 3D hand tracking. An anatomically accurate hand model is built from truncated quadrics. This allows for the generation of 2D profiles of the model using elegant tools from projective geometry, and for an efficient method to handle self-occlusion. The pose of the hand model is estimated with an Unscented Kalman filter (UKF), which minimizes the geometric error between the profiles and edges extracted from the images. The use of the UKF permits higher frame rates than more sophisticated estimation methods such as particle filtering, whilst providing higher accuracy than the extended Kalman filter The system is easily scalable from single to multiple views, and from rigid to articulated models. First experiments on real data using one and two cameras demonstrate the quality of the proposed method for tracking a 7 DOF hand model.},

We then show how we have attempted to use this model in tracking an unmarked hand moving with 6 degrees of freedom (plus deformation) in real time using a single video camera. In the course of this we show how to improve on a weighted least-squares pose parameter approximation at little computational cost. We note the successes and shortcomings of our system and discuss how it might be improved},
